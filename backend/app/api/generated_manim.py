<think>
Okay, I need to create a Manim scene that shows the relationship between sine and cosine on a unit circle. The point should move along the circumference, and the sine and cosine projections should be drawn dynamically on the axes. Also, labels and smooth transitions are needed to highlight the values as the point moves.

First, I'll start by setting up the unit circle. The unit circle has a radius of 1, centered at the origin. I'll draw the circle using the Circle class in Manim. Then, I'll add the x and y axes, probably using Axes or NumberLine for each axis, but maybe just two lines with labels. Hmm, maybe using Axes is better because it comes with labels and ticks already.

Next, I need a point moving along the circumference. That can be done with a Dot object whose position is parameterized by an angle theta. So, as theta increases from 0 to 2π, the dot moves around the circle. I can use ValueTracker to animate theta, so that the position of the dot is updated as theta changes.

Then, the projections. The cosine projection is the x-coordinate of the point, so projecting onto the x-axis. Similarly, sine is the y-coordinate, projected onto the y-axis. To show these projections, I can draw lines from the moving point to the axes. Maybe using DashedLine or Line with a different color for each projection.

For dynamically drawing the sine and cosine waves, I think I need to have two curves (for sine and cosine) that update as the point moves. Wait, but the problem says "dynamically drawing the sine and cosine projections onto the x- and y-axes". So maybe it's just the lines from the point to the axes, showing the current sine and cosine values as the point moves, not the entire sine/cosine wave over time. But the user might want to see the waves being traced as the point moves. Hmm, the original question says "dynamically drawing the sine and cosine projections". Maybe both the lines to the axes and the graphs building up over time? Let me check the original request again.

The user says: "Animate a point moving along the circle’s circumference while dynamically drawing the sine and cosine projections onto the x- and y-axes. Use labels and labels and smooth transitions to highlight the evolving values as the point moves."

So maybe the projections are the lines from the point to the axes, and also the graphs of sine and cosine being drawn as the point moves. So perhaps two parts: one is the projection lines that move with the point, and the other is the actual sine and cosine curves that are being plotted as the point moves around the circle.

But how to structure this. Let me think. Let me split the problem into components:

1. Unit circle with moving point.
2. Projection lines from the point to x and y axes, showing cosine (x) and sine (y) values.
3. Labels that display the current sine and cosine values, maybe as Text objects.
4. Possibly graphs of sine and cosine functions being drawn as the point moves.

But the user didn't explicitly mention the full sine and cosine waves, but "dynamically drawing the sine and cosine projections onto the x- and y-axes". Maybe just the lines and the values. However, illustrating the relationship might benefit from showing the curves. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps they want to have the projections as the moving lines, and as the point moves, the height on y-axis (sine) and the length on x-axis (cosine) are shown. Maybe with a horizontal line from the point to the y-axis and a vertical line to the x-axis. Then, labels that show the current value of sine and cosine.

Additionally, smooth transitions. So maybe when the point moves, the lines and labels update smoothly.

So here's a plan:

- Create a unit circle centered at the origin.
- Draw x and y axes with labels.
- Create a moving dot on the circle using ValueTracker for the angle.
- Draw dashed lines from the dot to the x and y axes, color-coded (e.g., blue for cosine, red for sine).
- Add labels next to the projection lines showing "sin(θ)" and "cos(θ)" with their current numerical values.
- Animate the movement of the dot, updating the lines and labels in real-time.
- Maybe add a trail or trace of the sine and cosine values over time, but since the user says "dynamically drawing the projections", maybe not. Or perhaps that's part of the "evolving values".

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to see the sine and cosine curves being plotted as functions over the angle. But in that case, the x-axis would represent the angle, and the y-axis the sine/cosine value. But the main unit circle has x and y as coordinates. Hmm. Maybe it's better to have separate axes for the sine and cosine graphs next to the unit circle. But that might complicate the scene. The original problem statement might just refer to the projections on the existing x and y axes of the unit circle.

Wait, in the unit circle, the x-coordinate is cosine(theta) and y-coordinate is sine(theta). So when the point is at angle theta, the horizontal line from the point to the y-axis (wait, no: to the x-axis is the x-coordinate, which is cosine. The vertical line to the y-axis would be the y-coordinate, which is sine. So, for example, a vertical dashed line from the point to the x-axis would represent the cosine value, and a horizontal dashed line to the y-axis would represent the sine value. Wait, no: the vertical line from the point (x,y) to the x-axis is (x,0), which shows the x-coordinate (cos(theta)), and the horizontal line to the y-axis is (0,y), showing the y-coordinate (sin(theta)).

So, the vertical line is for cosine, horizontal line for sine. Those lines can be animated as the point moves. The labels can show cos(theta) and sin(theta) with their numerical values, updating as theta changes.

So here's the step-by-step:

1. Create the unit circle.
2. Add x and y axes with labels.
3. Create a ValueTracker for theta, ranging from 0 to 2*PI.
4. Define a moving dot on the circle: dot = always_redraw(lambda: Dot(color=YELLOW).move_to(circle.point_at_angle(theta.get_value())))
   Or, use ParametricFunction with the angle parameter.
   Alternatively, use the parametric equation (cos(theta), sin(theta), 0) for the dot's position.

5. Create the vertical line (cosine projection) from the dot to the x-axis:
   cos_line = always_redraw(lambda: DashedLine(dot.get_center(), [dot.get_x(), 0, 0], color=BLUE))

6. Similarly, the horizontal line (sine projection) to the y-axis:
   sin_line = always_redraw(lambda: DashedLine(dot.get_center(), [0, dot.get_y(), 0], color=RED))

7. Create labels for sine and cosine:
   - For cosine: a label near the end of the cos_line (on the x-axis). Maybe a MathTex(r"\cos(\theta)") next to the point where cos_line meets the x-axis. And also display the current value. So, cos_label = always_redraw(lambda: Tex(f"cos(θ) = {np.cos(theta.get_value()):.2f}", color=BLUE).next_to([np.cos(theta.get_value()), 0, 0], DOWN))

   Similarly for sin_label.

But wait, how to make the labels update with the value. Using always_redraw with a lambda function that recalculates the position and text.

But for the text, in Manim, you can use a ValueTracker and a DecimalNumber to display the current value. Maybe better to use DecimalNumber for the numerical part and combine it with a Tex for the label.

Alternatively, use a Tex with a dynamic value. But Manim's Tex doesn't directly support dynamic values. So perhaps use DecimalNumber for the numbers and group them with static text.

For example:

cos_value = DecimalNumber(num_decimal_places=2).set_color(BLUE)
cos_label = always_redraw(lambda: VGroup(
    Tex("cos(θ) = "), cos_value
).arrange(RIGHT).next_to([np.cos(theta.get_value()), 0, 0], DOWN))

But then we need to update cos_value each time. So cos_value.add_updater(lambda m: m.set_value(np.cos(theta.get_value())))

Same for sin_value.

Yes, that's a way to do it. So:

cos_value = DecimalNumber(num_decimal_places=2, color=BLUE)
cos_label = always_redraw(lambda: VGroup(
    MathTex(r"\cos(\theta) = "), cos_value
).arrange(RIGHT, buff=0.2).next_to(
    np.array([np.cos(theta.get_value()), 0, 0]), DOWN, buff=0.1
))

Similarly for sin_label, but placed next to the y-axis.

But for the sin_label, positioning it next to the end of the sin_line on the y-axis. So:

sin_value = DecimalNumber(num_decimal_places=2, color=RED)
sin_label = always_redraw(lambda: VGroup(
    MathTex(r"\sin(\theta) = "), sin_value
).arrange(RIGHT, buff=0.2).next_to(
    np.array([0, np.sin(theta.get_value()), 0]), LEFT, buff=0.1
))

But to avoid overlapping with the axes, maybe position the sin_label to the left of the y-axis.

Then, add updaters to cos_value and sin_value to update their values based on theta.

Putting this all together:

- theta = ValueTracker(0)
- dot = always_redraw(lambda: Dot(color=YELLOW).move_to([np.cos(theta.get_value()), np.sin(theta.get_value()), 0]))
- cos_line = always_redraw(lambda: DashedLine(dot.get_center(), [dot.get_x(), 0, 0], color=BLUE))
- sin_line = always_redraw(lambda: DashedLine(dot.get_center(), [0, dot.get_y(), 0], color=RED))
- cos_value = DecimalNumber(num_decimal_places=2, color=BLUE).add_updater(lambda m: m.set_value(np.cos(theta.get_value())))
- sin_value = DecimalNumber(num_decimal_places=2, color=RED).add_updater(lambda m: m.set_value(np.sin(theta.get_value())))
- cos_label = always_redraw(lambda: VGroup(MathTex(r"\cos(\theta) = "), cos_value).arrange(RIGHT).next_to([np.cos(theta.get_value()), 0, 0], DOWN))
- sin_label = always_redraw(lambda: VGroup(MathTex(r"\sin(\theta) = "), sin_value).arrange(RIGHT).next_to([0, np.sin(theta.get_value()), 0], LEFT))

But need to make sure that the labels are added to the scene and updated properly.

Then, to animate, create an animation that changes theta from 0 to 2*PI over some duration.

Also, maybe add the unit circle labels, like the angle marker, or labels for the axes.

Additionally, maybe adding a line from the origin to the dot, representing the radius. That could help visualize the angle.

Another detail: when the dot moves, the projection lines and labels move smoothly. Since we're using always_redraw and ValueTracker, this should be handled automatically when theta is animated.

Now, about the actual animation. The main animation would be theta.tracker.animate.set_value(2*PI), but perhaps with a smooth rate. Also, maybe run_time can be set to 10 seconds or so for a full rotation.

Putting this into code:

Start with imports:

from manim import *
import numpy as np

Then, the scene class:

class SineCosineUnitCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Create axes
        axes = Axes(
            x_range=[-1.5, 1.5, 0.5],
            y_range=[-1.5, 1.5, 0.5],
            x_length=7,
            y_length=7,
            axis_config={"color": WHITE},
        )
        axes_labels = axes.get_axis_labels(x_label="x", y_label="y")

        # Create unit circle
        circle = Circle(radius=1, color=WHITE)
        circle.move_to(axes.c2p(0, 0))

        # Angle tracker
        theta = ValueTracker(0)

        # Moving dot on the circle
        dot = always_redraw(
            lambda: Dot(color=YELLOW).move_to(
                circle.point_at_angle(theta.get_value())
            )
        )

        # Projection lines
        cos_line = always_redraw(
            lambda: DashedLine(
                dot.get_center(),
                axes.c2p(np.cos(theta.get_value()), 0),
                color=BLUE,
                stroke_width=2,
            )
        )
        sin_line = always_redraw(
            lambda: DashedLine(
                dot.get_center(),
                axes.c2p(0, np.sin(theta.get_value())),
                color=RED,
                stroke_width=2,
            )
        )

        # Labels for sine and cosine values
        cos_value = DecimalNumber(num_decimal_places=2, color=BLUE)
        cos_label = always_redraw(
            lambda: VGroup(
                MathTex(r"\cos(\theta) = ", color=BLUE),
                cos_value,
            )
            .arrange(RIGHT)
            .next_to(axes.c2p(np.cos(theta.get_value()), 0), DOWN, buff=0.1)
        )
        cos_value.add_updater(lambda m: m.set_value(np.cos(theta.get_value())))

        sin_value = DecimalNumber(num_decimal_places=2, color=RED)
        sin_label = always_redraw(
            lambda: VGroup(
                MathTex(r"\sin(\theta) = ", color=RED),
                sin_value,
            )
            .arrange(RIGHT)
            .next_to(axes.c2p(0, np.sin(theta.get_value())), LEFT, buff=0.1)
        )
        sin_value.add_updater(lambda m: m.set_value(np.sin(theta.get_value())))

        # Radius line
        radius_line = always_redraw(
            lambda: Line(
                axes.c2p(0, 0),
                dot.get_center(),
                color=YELLOW,
                stroke_width=2,
            )
        )

        # Angle arc
        angle_arc = always_redraw(
            lambda: Arc(
                radius=0.3,
                start_angle=0,
                angle=theta.get_value(),
                arc_center=axes.c2p(0, 0),
                color=YELLOW,
            )
        )

        # Add all elements to the scene
        self.add(axes, axes_labels, circle)
        self.add(radius_line, angle_arc, dot, cos_line, sin_line, cos_label, sin_label)

        # Animate theta from 0 to 2*PI
        self.play(theta.animate.set_value(2 * PI), run_time=10, rate_func=linear)

But wait, need to test if all elements are properly added. The radius_line and angle_arc are optional but helpful for clarity. The labels might have issues with positioning, especially when theta is such that cos(theta) or sin(theta) is near the edges. Also, the DecimalNumber might need to be scaled if the values get too long.

Another thing: using axes.c2p (coordinate to point) is better for positioning elements according to the axes. For example, the dot's position can be calculated as axes.c2p(np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta)), but since the circle is at the origin, it's the same as circle.point_at_angle(theta.get_value()). However, using axes.c2p ensures that the positions align with the axes.

Alternatively, perhaps create the dot's position as:

dot_position = lambda: axes.c2p(np.cos(theta.get_value()), np.sin(theta.get_value()))
dot = always_redraw(lambda: Dot(color=YELLOW).move_to(dot_position()))

This way, the dot's position is directly tied to the axes coordinates. This might help in aligning the projection lines correctly.

Similarly, cos_line and sin_line can be drawn from the dot's position to the respective axes. For cos_line, the end point is (cos(theta), 0) in axes coordinates, which is axes.c2p(np.cos(theta.get_value()), 0). Similarly for sin_line.

This approach might be more robust, especially if the axes are scaled or shifted.

Moreover, when the axes are added with specific ranges, using c2p ensures correct positioning.

Also, the labels for cos and sin need to be placed next to the projection lines. Using next_to with the axes coordinates converted to points.

But in the code above, when we do axes.c2p(np.cos(theta...), 0), that gives the point on the x-axis where the projection lands, so the label can be placed next to that point.

Testing this code, when theta increases, the dot moves around the circle, the lines update, and the labels show the current sine and cosine values with two decimal places. The animation runs for 10 seconds, making a full rotation.

Potential issues:

1. The labels might overlap with the axes or other elements when theta is at certain angles. For example, when theta is near 0, the cos label is near (1,0), which is on the right side. The label is placed DOWN, so below the x-axis. When theta approaches π, the cos(theta) becomes -1, so the label is on the left side, but still placed DOWN, which is below the x-axis. Similarly, the sin label is placed LEFT of the y-axis. When sin is positive, the label is to the left of the top part of the y-axis, and when negative, to the left of the bottom part. This should be okay, but maybe adjust the buff (spacing) to prevent overlapping with the axes numbers.

2. The DecimalNumber might show numbers like 1.00 or -0.00, which is correct.

3. The angle arc (angle_arc) is drawn from 0 to theta, showing the current angle. However, since theta goes up to 2π, the arc will make a full circle. But as it's redrawn each frame, it should show the increasing angle.

4. The radius line connects the origin to the dot, which helps visualize the angle.

Additionally, to make the scene more engaging, the initial elements can be added step by step with animations. For example, first draw the circle and axes, then add the radius line and angle arc, then the dot, projection lines, and labels. But the code as written adds all elements at once and then animates theta. To have a smoother introduction, perhaps use self.play(Create(...)) for each element before starting the theta animation.

But the user asked for "smooth transitions", so maybe building up the scene with animations first.

Modifying the code to build up the elements step by step:

In the construct method:

self.play(Create(axes), Write(axes_labels))
self.play(Create(circle))
self.wait(0.5)
self.play(Create(radius_line), Create(angle_arc))
self.play(Create(dot))
self.play(Create(cos_line), Create(sin_line))
self.play(Write(cos_label), Write(sin_label))
self.wait(0.5)
self.play(theta.animate.set_value(2 * PI), run_time=10, rate_func=linear)

But in the current code, elements like radius_line and cos_line are created with always_redraw, which might not work with Create(). Because Create() expects a VMobject, but always_redraw returns a Mobject with updaters. So perhaps better to add them to the scene after setting up the updaters.

Alternatively, start by adding the static elements (axes, circle), then add the dynamic elements with updaters, and then animate theta.

But perhaps it's better to structure the code to first set up all the dynamic elements with updaters and then add them all at once before animating theta.

Alternatively, use .add() to include all the dynamic elements and then animate. But in Manim, when you add a Mobject with an updater, it will automatically update each frame.

In the initial code, after adding all elements, the self.play(theta.animate...) will animate theta, and the updaters will handle the rest.

However, when using Create(), it animates the drawing of the object. For dynamic objects that are always_redraw, using Create() might not work as intended. So perhaps for the initial setup, add the static objects with Create, then add the dynamic objects without animating their creation, since they update automatically.

So, revised code for construct():

def construct(self):
    # Create axes
    axes = Axes(
        x_range=[-1.5, 1.5, 0.5],
        y_range=[-1.5, 1.5, 0.5],
        x_length=7,
        y_length=7,
        axis_config={"color": WHITE},
    )
    axes_labels = axes.get_axis_labels(x_label="x", y_label="y")

    # Create unit circle
    circle = Circle(radius=1, color=WHITE)
    circle.move_to(axes.c2p(0, 0))

    # Angle tracker
    theta = ValueTracker(0)

    # Moving dot on the circle
    dot = always_redraw(
        lambda: Dot(color=YELLOW).move_to(
            axes.c2p(np.cos(theta.get_value()), np.sin(theta.get_value()))
        )
    )

    # Projection lines
    cos_line = always_redraw(
        lambda: DashedLine(
            dot.get_center(),
            axes.c2p(np.cos(theta.get_value()), 0),
            color=BLUE,
            stroke_width=2,
        )
    )
    sin_line = always_redraw(
        lambda: DashedLine(
            dot.get_center(),
            axes.c2p(0, np.sin(theta.get_value())),
            color=RED,
            stroke_width=2,
        )
    )

    # Labels for sine and cosine values
    cos_value = DecimalNumber(num_decimal_places=2, color=BLUE)
    cos_label = always_redraw(
        lambda: VGroup(
            MathTex(r"\cos(\theta) = ", color=BLUE),
            cos_value,
        )
        .arrange(RIGHT)
        .next_to(axes.c2p(np.cos(theta.get_value()), 0), DOWN, buff=0.1)
    )
    cos_value.add_updater(lambda m: m.set_value(np.cos(theta.get_value())))

    sin_value = DecimalNumber(num_decimal_places=2, color=RED)
    sin_label = always_redraw(
        lambda: VGroup(
            MathTex(r"\sin(\theta) = ", color=RED),
            sin_value,
        )
        .arrange(RIGHT)
        .next_to(axes.c2p(0, np.sin(theta.get_value())), LEFT, buff=0.1)
    )
    sin_value.add_updater(lambda m: m.set_value(np.sin(theta.get_value())))

    # Radius line
    radius_line = always_redraw(
        lambda: Line(
            axes.c2p(0, 0),
            dot.get_center(),
            color=YELLOW,
            stroke_width=2,
        )
    )

    # Angle arc
    angle_arc = always_redraw(
        lambda: Arc(
            radius=0.3,
            start_angle=0,
            angle=theta.get_value(),
            arc_center=axes.c2p(0, 0),
            color=YELLOW,
        )
    )

    # Build the scene step by step
    self.play(Create(axes), Write(axes_labels))
    self.play(Create(circle))
    self.wait(0.5)
    self.play(Create(radius_line), Create(angle_arc))
    self.play(Create(dot))
    self.play(Create(cos_line), Create(sin_line))
    self.play(Write(cos_label), Write(sin_label))
    self.wait(0.5)
    self.play(theta.animate.set_value(2 * PI), run_time=10, rate_func=linear)
    self.wait(2)

But again, using Create() on Mobjects with updaters might not work as expected. For example, when you call Create(radius_line), which is an always_redraw object, Manim might not know how to animate its creation. Instead, it's better to add these objects without animating their creation, since they are dynamic.

So perhaps, instead of using Create(), just add all static elements with self.add(), and then add the dynamic elements:

self.add(axes, axes_labels, circle)
self.add(radius_line, angle_arc, dot, cos_line, sin_line, cos_label, sin_label)
self.play(theta.animate.set_value(2 * PI), run_time=10, rate_func=linear)

But then the elements appear instantly. To make it more engaging, we can animate the creation of the static elements first.

For example:

self.play(Create(axes), Write(axes_labels))
self.play(Create(circle))
self.wait(0.5)
self.play(Create(radius_line), Create(angle_arc))
self.play(Create(dot))
self.play(Create(cos_line), Create(sin_line))
self.play(Write(cos_label), Write(sin_label))
self.wait(0.5)
self.play(theta.animate.set_value(2 * PI), run_time=10, rate_func=linear)

But when you call Create(radius_line), which is an always_redraw Mobject, Manim might not handle it properly. Instead, perhaps create a static version of the radius_line and then replace it with the dynamic one.

Alternatively, realize that when using always_redraw, the object is updated every frame, so even if you Create() it, it will adapt. But I'm not sure. Testing would be needed. To avoid issues, perhaps construct the static elements first, then add the dynamic ones without animating their creation.

Alternatively, create a VGroup that contains all dynamic elements and add them at once.

But given time constraints, perhaps the initial code is sufficient, with all elements added at once, and then theta is animated. But the step-by-step buildup would make the scene more didactic.

Alternatively, create the scene in parts:

- First show the circle and axes.

- Then show the radius line and angle arc.

- Then add the dot and projections.

- Then add the labels.

- Then animate the motion.

But each step requires adding new elements with their own animations.

Alternatively, start with the circle and axes, then add the dot and its projections, then animate.

Another possible issue: the DecimalNumber may not update unless their updaters are added. In the code above, cos_value and sin_value have add_updater called, which should handle that.

Potential improvements:

- Color-coding: make the cosine line and label blue, sine red.

- Adding a legend or title.

- Adding the equation of the circle (x² + y² = 1) as text.

But the user didn't mention that, so maybe it's optional.

Another thing: the axes may have numbers that overlap with the projection labels. To prevent this, maybe shift the axes' number placement or adjust the label positions. Alternatively, make the axes ranges larger to have more space.

In the Axes definition, x_range and y_range are set to [-1.5, 1.5, 0.5], which gives some space beyond the unit circle. The labels are placed at the ends of the axes, but the projection labels (cos and sin) are placed next to the projection points on the axes. With the current setup, when the projection is at 1 or -1 on the x-axis, the label is placed below, which may not overlap with the axes numbers (which are at the edges). Similarly, the y-axis labels are on the left side, which shouldn't overlap with the axes numbers on the right.

Testing this would be necessary, but assuming the default Axes configuration doesn't place numbers at every 0.5, but according to the x_range and y_range step. Wait, in the Axes definition, x_range is [-1.5, 1.5, 0.5], so numbers at -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5. But the unit circle is radius 1, so the projections go from -1 to 1. The labels for cos and sin will be placed at positions like 1.0 (down) or -1.0 (down), which are where the axes have numbers. So there could be overlap. To prevent that, perhaps adjust the axes to not show numbers at -1 and 1, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, shift the projection labels slightly away. For example, for the cos_label, instead of DOWN, use direction DOWN+RIGHT*0.3 when the cosine is positive, and DOWN+LEFT*0.3 when negative. But how to do that dynamically.

Alternatively, use a fixed direction, but this might not look good. Alternatively, use a buff parameter to increase the distance from the point.

In the current code, the cos_label is next_to the projection point on the x-axis with direction DOWN and buff=0.1. If the axes numbers are at positions like 1.0 with their own labels, the cos_label might be placed below them, leading to overlap. To avoid this, perhaps move the cos_label to the side when near the edges.

But this complicates the code. Perhaps it's acceptable for the labels to overlap slightly, or adjust the z-index so that the cos_label is drawn on top. In Manim, the order of adding objects affects their z-index; later-added objects are drawn on top. So adding the labels after the axes might make them appear on top.

Alternatively, use always_redraw with a more sophisticated positioning function that avoids the axes numbers. For example, for the cos_label, when the projection is near 1 or -1, shift the label further down or to the side.

But this requires more complex code. For simplicity, perhaps leave it as is, assuming that the slight overlap is acceptable for the educational purpose.

Another point: the angle arc (angle_arc) is drawn from 0 to theta, but when theta exceeds PI, the arc will start to overlap itself. However, since it's always_redraw, it will redraw the arc each frame, so it should look like a growing arc up to 2PI, then disappearing, but since theta is animated smoothly, it should create a continuous growing arc. Wait, no: as theta increases, the arc's angle is theta.get_value(), so it will go from 0 to 2PI, making a full circle. However, the arc is only drawn once, but with always_redraw, it's recreated each frame. So visually, it should appear as the arc growing from 0 to 2PI, which is correct.

Another detail: the radius line is colored yellow like the dot, which helps associate it with the moving point.

Overall, this code should create a smooth animation of a point moving around the unit circle, with dynamic dashed lines projecting to the x and y axes, labels showing the current sine and cosine values, and a radius line with an angle arc. The animation lasts 10 seconds for a full rotation, with the labels and lines updating in real-time.

Potential areas for improvement:

- Adding a trace of the sine and cosine values over time as graphs, but this complicates the scene and wasn't explicitly requested.

- Adding more visual cues, such as marking the angle in degrees or radians.

- Adjusting label positions dynamically to avoid overlapping with axes numbers.

But given the user's request, the current code should fulfill the requirements.

Here's a Manim scene that illustrates the relationship between sine and cosine on a unit circle with dynamic projections and labels:

```python

        circle = Circle(radius=1, color=WHITE)
        circle.move_to(axes.c2p(0, 0))

        ).arrange(RIGHT).next_to(
            axes.c2p(np.cos(theta.get_value()), 0), DOWN, buff=0.15
        ))

        sin_value = DecimalNumber(num_decimal_places=2, color=RED)
        sin_label = always_redraw(lambda: VGroup(

        ))

        # Add updaters to numerical values
        cos_value.add_updater(lambda m: m.set_value(np.cos(theta.get_value())))
        sin_value.add_updater(lambda m: m.set_value(np.sin(theta.get_value())))

        # Visual elements for angle representation
        radius_line = always_redraw(lambda: Line(
            axes.c2p(0, 0), dot.get_center(), color=YELLOW, stroke_width=2
        ))

        angle_arc = always_redraw(lambda: Arc(
            radius=0.3,
            start_angle=0,
            angle=theta.get_value(),
            arc_center=axes.c2p(0, 0),
            color=YELLOW
        ))

        # Build the scene with animated introductions
        self.play(Create(axes), Write(axes_labels))
        self.play(Create(circle))
        self.wait(0.5)
        
        self.play(
            Create(radius_line),
            Create(angle_arc),
            Create(dot),
            run_time=2
        )
        
        self.play(
            Create(cos_line), 
            Create(sin_line),
            Write(cos_label),
            Write(sin_label),
            run_time=2
        )
        self.wait(0.5)

        # Animate full rotation with smooth transition
        self.play(
            theta.animate.set_value(2 * PI),
            rate_func=linear,
            run_time=10
        )
        self.wait(2)
```

This scene features:

1. A unit circle with coordinate axes
2. A yellow dot moving around the circumference
3. Dashed projection lines to both axes (blue for cosine, red for sine)
4. Dynamic labels showing current sine and cosine values
5. A rotating radius line and angle arc
6. Smooth animations for all elements
7. Total animation time of ~15 seconds (10 seconds for full rotation)

The animation demonstrates:
- How cosine corresponds to the x-projection
- How sine corresponds to the y-projection
- The periodic nature of both functions
- The relationship between angular position and function values
- Real-time updates of function values during motion

To run this, save it as a Python file and execute with Manim:
```bash
manim -pql sine_cosine_demo.py SineCosineUnitCircle
```
